# emm-intent
Configurable intents to be copied from Scan2Deploy Studio

## Format
The required properties for new EMM entries are:
 * `displayName`: Label displayed to the user for selection
 * `intent`: Structured intent for EMM (see [Configuring intents](#configuring-intents))

Example:
```diff
{
  "version": "X.X.X",
  "emms": {
-    "existingEmm": {}
+    "existingEmm": {},
+    "newEmm": {
+      "displayName": "New EMM",
+      "intent": " ... "
+    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring intents
There are two placeholders that can be used to define where the corresponding data should be injected into the intent.
 * `%encoding%`: Will be replaced with the current encoding version selected in Studio
 * `%data%`: Will be replaced with the encrypted barcode data generated by Studio

**Note: if a double quote is required within the final output of the intent, a single backslash will need to be used to escape the quote (e.g. `"example intent \"surrounded by escaped quotes\""`)**

#### Example
Given the following:
 * intent definition: "intent -encoding %encoding% -data %data%"
 * Studio barcode version: "v3"
 * Studio barcode data: "T3yYK0x8dt"

Resulting intent: 
`intent -encoding v3 -data T3yYK0x8dt`
